# DataExplorationSQL

-Link to Dataset https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

-Fun project working with SQL queries and exploring the covid data
-I split the table into two tables; CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations
-I explored the individual tables and later used joins to join the two tables to
query data that required both tables
