<h3>Link to Dataset https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths</h3>

 <h4>Fun project working with SQL queries and exploring the covid data</h4>
 <h4>I split the table into two tables; CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations</h4>
 <h4>I explored the individual tables and later used joins to join the two tables to</h4>
 <h4>query data that required both tables</h4>
